👨🏼‍💻Hello! I’m Dicky Setiono, and I’m an computer science graduate student at Dian Nuswantoro University. This site serves my blog, where I share my technical experience in articles and tutorials as well as random thoughts. I write about my personal mainly travel-related software projects and useful tricks I had learned at work, and cyber security issues.

🛩 For several years, now I like traveling and climbing mountains but everything has stopped since the Covid-19 outbreak has hit Indonesia

☕ When I’m not on a computer, I’m probably making drip coffee or searching the best fast food joint out there.

Thank you for visiting my website!
